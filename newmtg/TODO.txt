TODO
====

* implement a mtg with colors
  * mtg = tree + [colors(scale)]
  * operations on mtg
    + add a scale
    + intersection, union on mtg

* dynamic mtg

* interpolation
  + mapping between mtgs
  + interpolation to obtain a mtg from others

* standard
  + Read a mtg from aml code (*.mtg file)
  + Class acting as the old implementation/interface
  + Compare both implementation
    - result
    - performances

* Conversion: read / write methods
  + tulip
  + graphviz
  + L-system

* PlantFrame
  + write plantframe algorithm
  + write Weber& Penn on mtg
  + add new constraints

* Benchmark
  + test various implementation 
    - tulip
    - bgl
    - NetworkX


23/06/08
========
* parse L-system: lsystem2mtg
* parse mtg string
* pre, post-order iterators on trees
* iterators on mtg
* mtg with properties
* tests

04/06/2008
==========
* write a component retrieval
* add new test
* add traversal algorithms for tree (pre and post order) without huge recursivity
* add traversal with a visitor (usefullness?)
* test mtg structure with lots of elements 
  + 1200000 elts use 117MB of memory

03/06/2008
==========
* first implementation
* write tests


05/05/2008
==========
* write a simple test
* write the code as simple as possible
* define interfaces & documentation
* first implementation

14/11/2007
==========

* build mtg package
