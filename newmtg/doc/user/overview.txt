Openalea.Mtg defines a Multiscale Tree Graph data structure or **MTG** for short.

This data structure is compatible with the standard MTG format.
For compatibility reasons, all the AMAPmod interfaces have been implemented in this package.
However, this is a completly new implementation.

If you have any problems, please contact the author or send a mail on the mailing list.
